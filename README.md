# Universal Doom Voxel Weapons for VR

A GZDoom voxel weapon mod for Doom/Heretic/Hexen/Strife/Chex by Ermac (https://www.reddit.com/user/iAmErmac)

By design, this mod should allow the Doom Voxel VR weapons working with the other map-packs and gameplay mods which don't change the monsters and weapon system too much from the vanilla Doom/Heretic/Hexen/Chex/Strife etc.

There are optional second weapon set, voxel pickup models, bullet tracer and particle/smoke (Enhanced mode) effects for the weapons available in the **Voxel weapons Settings**. When enhanced mode is enabled, the Super Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle and BFG will have alt-fire enabled. In vanilla mode only BFG has alt-fire enabled (Doom beta BFG effect as alt-fire).

# Features

* Can switch between 2 sets of voxel weapons anytime
* Optional enhanced mode. More SFX and smokes, enables alt-fire
* Optional voxel pickup models
* Optional bullet tracer for pistol, shotgun and machinegun (works regardless of enhanced mode)
* Optional fast weapon switching mode
